# 👋 Hi, I'm Gilberto!

I'm a backend developer with over 10 years of experience in the IT industry, now transitioning into the ServiceNow ecosystem with a strong focus on automation, scripting, and backend logic. I have a degree in Digital Games from PUC Minas (Brazil), and I'm bringing my multidisciplinary background into the world of enterprise platforms.

🧠 **Learning by building** — all my apps are created using my Personal Developer Instance (PDI) and shared here to document real progress.

- Migrating from backend development to ServiceNow
- Building real-world apps in ServiceNow
